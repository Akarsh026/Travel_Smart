Add to Project: Place the downloaded google-services.json file into the app/ module directory of your Android Studio project.

Enable Services:

In the Firebase Console, go to Authentication and enable the Email/Password sign-in method.

Go to Realtime Database and create a database instance.

### 4. Run the Application
Select your desired device/emulator from the toolbar (using the AVD Manager if needed).

Click the "Run 'app'" button (the green triangle) in the Android Studio toolbar.
